Problem: Stake holders are looking for the best place to open a new dine-in restaurant in the city of Philadelphia. 
To solve this problem the Foursquare API will be used to gather data on the neighborhoods in Philadelphia and to explore the different types of restaraunts 
that they have to offer. The data will by clustered to find which neighborhoods have successful restaraunts, but are not too crouwded with restaraunts already.
